        joined the army right after. After i got out of the army i used the GI bill to get a degree in computer
        forensics from strayer university. During my last year in college i interned from a company in Orlando FL
        called Ellucian. I was in the data security department and learned a good bit about port scanning and 
        making reports using rapid 7. After the intership was over i moved back to norhtern VA and got married but
        never got back into the IT feild. After my divorce i decided it was time to use my degree so i found this 
        class and enrolled</p>
